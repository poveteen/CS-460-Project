# Voice Assistant - Tux
## Senior Project - Wartburg College

### Background

I am an Undergraduate student of senior standing at [Wartburg College](https://www.wartburg.edu/) pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Actuarial Science. For my senior project, I wanted to research and puruse machine learning, and get to learn what various techniques are implemented to make a voice assistant work. After being introduced by Dr. John Zelle, and along with some research, I found [MycroftAI](https://mycroft.ai/)'s team that provided the [tools](https://github.com/MycroftAI) that I could use to create my own voice assistant. 

This is completely a research-based project since I had litlle knowledge of machine learning, and no knowledge of the tools provided by MycroftAI. Thus, as I learn along, this page will provide further information regarding the things I have achieved thus far. 

### Git

The first thing I did was install git on my machine. 

```markdown
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt install git`
```

Then I cloned the MycroftAI's [mycroft-precise repository](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-precise) and initiated my local git repository within that folder.

```markdown
`git clone https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-precise`
`git init`
`git add .`
`git commit -m <comment>`
```
